# OneMap

`OneMap` is a software for constructing genetic maps in experimental
crosses: full-sib, RILs, F2 and backcrosses. It was developed by
Gabriel R A Margarido, Marcelo Mollinari and A Augusto F Garcia.

It has been available on CRAN from several years
(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/onemap/index.html). Its last
version was updated on 2013-09-09. CRAN has OneMap's stable version,
which is recommend for most users.

This github page has his version under development. New functions will
be added (experimental work) and, once it is done, we will synchronize
the repositories and add it to CRAN.

We are working very hard to release a new stable version allowing
users to analyze data sets with markers based on sequencing
technologies, such as Illumina, GBS, etc.

`OneMap` comprises by a set of functions that allows users to build a
linkage map. Some functions are used internally by the package, and
should not be used directly.

# How to install

## From CRAN (stable version)

It is easy, just type (within R):

```R
install.packages("onemap", dependencies=TRUE)
```

Some Linux users reported the error message below:

```R
ERROR: dependency ‘tkrplot’ is not available for package ‘onemap’
```

To fix it, in a terminal (outside R), install `r-cran-tkrplot`:

```R
sudo apt-get install r-cran-tkrplot
```

Then, go back to `R` and install `OneMap` as mentioned above.

You also can use the console menus: _Packages -> Install
package(s)_. After clicking, a box will pop-up asking you to choose
the CRAN mirror. Choose the location nearest you. Then, another box
will pop-up asking you to choose the package you want to install.
Select _onemap_ then click _OK_. The package will be
automatically installed on your computer.

`OneMap` can also be installed by downloading the appropriate files
directly at the CRAN web site and following the instructions given in
the section `6.3 Installing Packages` of the
[R Installation and Administration](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.pdf)
manual.

## From github (version under development)

Within R, you need to install and load the package `devtools`:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

This will allow you to automatically build and install packages from
github. If you use Windows, first install
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). On a Mac,
you will need Xcode (available on the App Store). On Linux, you are
good to go.

Dependencies: you also need to install `r-cran-tkrplot` (see above)
and a few packages from Bioconductor (try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported):

```R
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Rhtslib")
biocLite("zlibbioc")
```

Then, to install `OneMap` from github (this very repo):

```R
install_github("augusto-garcia/onemap")
```
