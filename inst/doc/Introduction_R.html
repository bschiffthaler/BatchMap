<h1>Introduction to R</h1>

<p>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. To download R, please visit the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">Comprehensive R Archive
Network</a>. You do not need to be an expert
on it to be able to build you linkage map using <code>OneMap</code>.</p>

<p>Although we prefer and recommend the Linux version, in this tutorial
it is assumed that the user is running Windows. Users of R under Linux
or Mac OS should have no difficult in following this tutorial.</p>

<p>We would like to recommend that new users, instead of using plain R,
use it through the fantastic software
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>. With this package, there is no
noticeable difference between the operation system you are using.</p>

<p>As advertised on the website, <em>RStudio is an integrated development
environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting
editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for
plotting, history, debugging and workspace management</em>. In another
words, it offers a number of facilities for your convenience that will
make your live easier, specially if you never use R before.</p>

<p>So, go ahead and download and install R and RStudio. The window on the
left is where you type the R commands you want.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>In the left window, you can see a <em>greater than</em> sign (&ldquo;&gt;&#39;&#39;), which
means that R is waiting for a command. We call this a <em>prompt</em>. </p>

<p>Let us start with a simple example adding two numbers. Type <code>2+3</code> at the
prompt then type the <em>Enter</em> key. You will see the result directly on
the screen.</p>

<pre><code class="r">2+3
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 5
</code></pre>

<p>You can store this result into a variable for future use, applying the
assignment operator _ &lt;- _ (<em>less than</em> sign and _ minus_ altogether):</p>

<pre><code class="r">x &lt;- 2+3
</code></pre>

<p>The result of the calculation was stored into the variable <em>x</em>. You
can access this result typing <em>x</em> at the prompt:</p>

<pre><code class="r">x
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 5
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use the variable <em>x</em> into another calculations. For
example:</p>

<pre><code class="r">x+4 
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 9
</code></pre>

<p>So, play a little just to start understanding what is going on.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>Another fundamental aspect in R is the usage of <em>functions</em>. A
function is a predefined routine used to do specific calculations. For
example, to calculate the natural logarithm of \(6.7\), we can use the
function <em>log</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="r">log(6.7)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 1.902108
</code></pre>

<p>The function <em>log</em> contains a group of internal procedures to
calculate the natural logarithm of a positive real number. The input
values of a function are called <em>arguments</em>. </p>

<p>In the previous example, we provided only one argument (\(6.7\)) to the
function. Sometimes a function has more than one argument. For
example, to obtain the logarithm of \(6.7\) on base \(4\), you can use:</p>

<pre><code class="r">log(6.7, base=4)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 1.372081
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to calculate the natural logarithm of a set of numbers
by defining a vector and using it as the first argument of the
function <em>log</em>. To do so we use the function <em>c()</em>, that <em>combines</em> a
set of values into a vector. Thus, to calculate the logarithm of the
numbers 6.7, 3.2, 5.4, 8.1, 4.9, 9.7 and 2.5, one can use:</p>

<pre><code class="r">y &lt;- c(6.7, 3.2, 5.4, 8.1, 4.9, 9.7, 2.5)
log(y)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 1.9021075 1.1631508 1.6863990 2.0918641 1.5892352 2.2721259 0.9162907
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <em>y</em> is a vector, that is the argument to the function
<em>log()</em>.</p>

<h2>Getting help</h2>

<p>Every R function has a help page which can be accessed using a
question mark before the name of the function. For example, to get
help on function <em>log</em>, you would type:</p>

<pre><code class="r">?log
</code></pre>

<p>This command will open a help page in the default web browser of your
system. The help page contains some important information about the
function such its syntax, its arguments and some usage examples.</p>

<p>There are many other ways of getting help, of course. For example, from RStudio,
click <em>Help</em> on the menu. For doing searches on the internet, it is
better first go to <a href="http://rseek.org/">http://rseek.org/</a>, since R
is a very common letter to include in searches.  </p>

<h2>Packages</h2>

<p>Although R has a huge amount of internal functions, for doing very
specific computations (like constructing genetic linkage maps), it is
necessary to add extra functionalities. These can be done by
installing a <em>package</em> (that, loosely speaking, will include a number
of new functions for helping you to achieve what you are trying to
do). A package is a collection of related functions, help files and
example data files that have been bundled together (Adler, 2010).</p>

<p>For example, let us assume that you need to convert a set of
recombination fractions into centimorgan distance using the Kosambi
mapping function. One possible way to do this is by using the basic R
to write a function to calculate the distances. Another way is use the
<em>OneMap</em> package. To install it you can type:</p>

<pre><code class="r">install.packages(&quot;onemap&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>You also can use the console menus on RStudio. On the bottom window on
right, select <strong>Packages</strong>, then <strong>Install</strong> and finally select
<em>OneMap</em> (select CRAN as your repository). Yes, it is that easy!</p>

<p>Returning to the console, you need to load <em>OneMap</em> by typing:</p>

<pre><code class="r">library(onemap)
</code></pre>

<p>Some Linux users reported the error message below:</p>

<pre><code class="r">ERROR: dependency ‘tkrplot’ is not available for package ‘onemap’
</code></pre>

<p>To fix it, in a terminal (outside R), install <code>r-cran-tkrplot</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="r">sudo apt-get install r-cran-tkrplot
</code></pre>

<p>To finish our example, let us enter some recombination fractions, for
example, 0.01, 0.12, 0.05, 0.11, 0.21, 0.07, and save it into a
variable named <em>rf</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rf &lt;- c(0.01, 0.12, 0.05, 0.11, 0.21, 0.07)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let us use <em>OneMap</em>&#39;s function <em>kosambi</em> to do the calculation:</p>

<pre><code class="r">kosambi(rf)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1]  1.000133 12.238706  5.016767 11.182805 22.384601  7.046279
</code></pre>

<p>You can also obtain help on the function <em>kosambi</em> using the
question mark in the same way it was done before:</p>

<pre><code class="r">?kosambi
</code></pre>

<h2>Importing and exporting data</h2>

<p>So far, we entered the variables in R by typing them directly into the
console. However, in real situations we usually <strong>read these values
from a file</strong> or a data bank (including files on the internet). </p>

<p>To learn this procedure, copy and paste the following table into a
text editor (for example, <em>notepad</em>) and save it to a file called
<em>test.txt</em> into any directory in your computer (such as <em>My
Documents</em>).</p>

<pre><code>    x       y
 2.13    4.50
 4.48    1.98
10.95    9.29
10.03   16.25
12.72   27.38
24.63   22.60
22.57   36.87
29.78   31.73
19.54   10.42
 7.86   14.68
11.75    8.68
23.71   37.39
</code></pre>

<p>To read these data set into R, first, you have to set the working
directory. Go to <em>Session</em>, then <em>Set Working Directory</em>, and <em>Choose
Directory</em>, pointing to where you saved the file <em>test.txt</em>.</p>

<p>Now let us read the file <em>test.txt</em> into R and store it in a variable
named <em>dat</em>. To do this, we can use using the R function <em>read.table</em>.
The first argument is the name of the file; the second one indicates
if the file contains a header, i. e. if the first line of the file
contains the names of the variables (which is true for our example):</p>

<pre><code class="r">dat &lt;- read.table(file=&quot;test.txt&quot;, header=TRUE)
dat
</code></pre>

<pre><code>##        x     y
## 1   2.13  4.50
## 2   4.48  1.98
## 3  10.95  9.29
## 4  10.03 16.25
## 5  12.72 27.38
## 6  24.63 22.60
## 7  22.57 36.87
## 8  29.78 31.73
## 9  19.54 10.42
## 10  7.86 14.68
## 11 11.75  8.68
## 12 23.71 37.39
</code></pre>

<p>The second line, with <em>dat</em>, is necessary to ask R to return the
results of the object <em>dat</em> (i. e., the data itself). Inspecting the
object <em>dat</em> you can see a table with 12 rows and two columns. The
names of the columns are <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. We can access the
variables in columns using the dollar sign followed by the column
name:</p>

<pre><code class="r">dat$x
</code></pre>

<pre><code>##  [1]  2.13  4.48 10.95 10.03 12.72 24.63 22.57 29.78 19.54  7.86 11.75
## [12] 23.71
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">dat$y 
</code></pre>

<pre><code>##  [1]  4.50  1.98  9.29 16.25 27.38 22.60 36.87 31.73 10.42 14.68  8.68
## [12] 37.39
</code></pre>

<p>It is also possible to use the function <em>summary</em> to extract some
information about the object <em>dat</em>, or about each one of the columns
separately:</p>

<pre><code class="r">summary(dat)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>##        x                y         
##  Min.   : 2.130   Min.   : 1.980  
##  1st Qu.: 9.488   1st Qu.: 9.137  
##  Median :12.235   Median :15.465  
##  Mean   :15.012   Mean   :18.481  
##  3rd Qu.:22.855   3rd Qu.:28.468  
##  Max.   :29.780   Max.   :37.390
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">summary(dat$x)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   2.130   9.487  12.240  15.010  22.860  29.780
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">summary(dat$y)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   1.980   9.138  15.460  18.480  28.470  37.390
</code></pre>

<p>The function <em>summary</em> provides some descriptive statistics about the
variables in the dataset. If you want to export these information to a
file you can use the function <em>write.table</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="r">write.table(x=summary(dat), file=&quot;testsum.txt&quot;, quote=FALSE)
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument is the output of the <em>summary</em> function. Note that
is possible to use a function as an argument of another one. The
second argument is the name of the file in which the summary will be
written. Notice that this will happen in the <em>working directory</em>,
previously set through RStudio menus. The third argument eliminates
double quotes from the output file. After running the command, you can
look for the file <em>testsum.txt</em> in the working directory you defined
before.</p>

<h2>Classes and methods</h2>

<p>In R, every object belongs to a <strong><em>class</em></strong>. This is a simple concept
that you must remember. For example, the object mentioned above <em>dat</em>
belongs to class <em>data.frame</em>. We can obtain this information using
the function <em>class</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="r">class(dat)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>When we used the function <em>summary</em>, it automatically recognized the
class of the object <em>dat</em> and applied a specific procedure developed
for class <em>data.frame</em>, which in this case involves the computation of
some descriptive statistics.</p>

<p>This procedure is named <em>method</em>. However, another classes of objects
can be used as arguments to function <em>summary</em> and the result will be
different!</p>

<p>For example, let us adjust a linear (regression) model using column <em>y</em> as the
response variable, and column <em>x</em> as the independent one. This can be done
with the function <em>lm()</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="r">ft.mod &lt;- lm(dat$y~dat$x)
ft.mod
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = dat$y ~ dat$x)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)        dat$x  
##       1.803        1.111
</code></pre>

<p>This function  is used to fit linear models and, by default, returns
just a formula and the coefficients of the linear regression. Object
<em>ft.mod</em> have class <em>lm</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="r">class(ft.mod)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;lm&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>So, if we use function <em>summary</em> to obtain more information about the
fitted model, the result will be:</p>

<pre><code class="r">summary(ft.mod)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = dat$y ~ dat$x)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -13.091  -5.144  -1.413   5.421  11.446 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)
## (Intercept)   1.8026     4.7689   0.378  0.71334
## dat$x         1.1110     0.2771   4.009  0.00248
## 
## Residual standard error: 8.075 on 10 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.6164, Adjusted R-squared:  0.5781 
## F-statistic: 16.07 on 1 and 10 DF,  p-value: 0.002482
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, function <em>summary</em> recognizes <em>ft.mod</em> as an object of
class <em>lm</em> and applies a method which shows information about the
fitted model, such as the distribution of the residuals, regression
coefficients, t-tests, and the coefficient of determination (\(r^2\)),
etc.</p>

<p>Thus, it is possible to use the same function in different classes of
object to obtain different results. This concept is very important in
<em>OneMap</em> and you must remember it to use the package. For example, in
other vignettes, it will be showed that depending on the class of the
dataset, which can be <em>outcross</em>, <em>f2.onemap</em>, <em>bc.onemap</em>,
<em>riself.onemap</em> and <em>risib.onemap</em>, a certain set of procedures will
be applied. Not by coincidence, these classes correspond to all types
of populations that can be analyzed. The advantage of this approach is
that you do not need to change the function to do a specific analysis;
it will recognize the object type and will adapt accordingly.</p>

<h2>Saving your work</h2>

<p>Finally, you need how to save your work to come back to it in another
working session. But before we explain how to do that, let us explain
a few other concepts.</p>

<p>We can save your <strong><em>R Script</em></strong>, which is the file that has all R
instructions you typed so far. So, you load the them and run all
instructions again to have the same results. This is easy, just click
<em>File</em>, <em>Save As</em>, and choose a directory and a name (usually with the
extension .R, such as Example1.R, etc).</p>

<p>A different thing is to save your <strong>R Session</strong>, with all objects you
created so far (called <em>R Workspace</em>). This is not the same, since
once you load the workspace, you will have all the objects already
loaded, not requiring you to do everything again, i. e, running your
script. This will help you to save a lot of time, since some of the
analysis required to build linkage maps are time demanding.</p>

<p>To do so, click <em>Session</em>, then <em>Save Workspace As</em> and choose a
directory and name. In your next session, open RStudio and then go to
<em>Session</em>, <em>Load Workspace</em>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can do that using the R function <em>save.image</em>, For
example, if you want to save your analysis in a file named
<em>myworkspace.RData</em>, you should use:</p>

<pre><code class="r">save.image(&quot;myworkspace.RData&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>To load:</p>

<pre><code class="r">load(&quot;myworkspace.RData&quot;)
</code></pre>
