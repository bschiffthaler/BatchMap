This file contains a list of changes and updates for package OneMap, started since version 1.0-1, which corresponds to the inclusion of multipoint methods.

Version 1.0-1

* improvements for backcross and F2: reading data with MAPMAKER/EXP format; no redundant calculations regarding linkage phases; different criteria for initial framework (order.seq)

* rf.2pts: new progress bar

* the number of markers in a given sequence is now printed

* rf.graph.table now displays LOD scores above the diagonal

* rf.graph table now displays marker numbers, not names
