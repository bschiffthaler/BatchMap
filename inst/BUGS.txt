This file contains a list of fixed bugs for package OneMap, started since version 1.0-1, which corresponds to the inclusion of multipoint methods.

Version 1.0-1

* order.seq: now checks for THRES value

* print.order fixed: problem with symbols "***" and "*" with low THRES value

* print.try fixed: potential spacing issues depending on the number of markers

* rf.2pts fixed: recombination fractions is set to 0.5 and LOD to 0.0 for pairs of markers for which no overlapping information is available

* group fixed: now printing the sequence object from which it was generated (not the outcross object)

* group fixed: major bug when the input sequence did not contain all markers
