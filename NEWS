Patch update: 1.0.1.0
  This is a patch release that addresses build errors on Windows (R-oldrelease)
  and Solaris (all versions).
  Changes:
    - Changed identifiers in C++ sources to not start with an underscore and a
    - Changed std::stoul() to strtoul() from <cstdlib> as the C++11 compiler did
    not support std::stoul()
